## MongoDB_SmartParking_Visual is closely connected to the project [smart-parking](https://github.com/gabrieldimi/smart-parking).

This project is used solely to visualize the smart parking data from the project mentioned above.
The data is visualized through the html pages which are using bootstrap. This project is obviously extensible because it connects to mongoDB and
